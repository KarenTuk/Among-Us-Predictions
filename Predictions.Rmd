## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
# Loading in the tidyverse library and the Among Us Game Data
library(tidyverse)

amongus <- readr::read_csv("User1.csv")

amongus %>% glimpse()
```
```{r}
# Retrieving important values from the data that will help us analyze and make predictions
# Determining the total number of games and the number of wins and losses

total <- amongus %>% count()
total[[1]]

Outcome <- amongus %>% group_by(Outcome)
mogus_tibble <- tibble(Outcome)
mogus_tibble %>% group_by(Outcome) %>% summarize(count=n())
```

```{r}
# Further visualizing the predictions
# Using the sample function to select random samples from the data and find similar probabilities for winning a game of Among Us based on the data

mogus_tibble %>%
  sample_n(size = total[[1]], replace = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(Outcome) %>%
  filter(Outcome == "Win") %>%
  summarize(n(), p_win = n()/total[[1]])
```
```{r}
# Estimating the sampling distribution of probability to win the next game of Among Us based on the data (wins/losses of previous games)
# The sampling distribution is the distribution of all values that the probability of winning a game could be for random samples from the data
# To estimate the sampling distribution, I took 1000 values from the probabilty of winning and calculated 1000 randoms samples from the population (main data)

sample_pwin <- rep(NA, 1000)

for(i in 1:1000){
  sample_100 <- mogus_tibble %>% sample_n(size=total[[1]], replace = TRUE)
  sample_pwin[i] <-
    sample_100 %>%
    filter(Outcome == "Win") %>%
    summarise(n()/total[[1]]) %>%
    as.numeric()
}

sample_pwin <- tibble(p_win = (sample_pwin)) %>% glimpse()
```
```{r}
# This is a histogram displaying the sampling distribution of the probability of winning a game of Among Us
# The graph is normal distribution 
# Also calculated the confidence interval of the sampling distribution, where we can estimate with a 95% confidence what the probability of winning the next game of Among Us

ggplot(sample_pwin, aes(x = p_win)) + geom_histogram()

quantile_tibble <- quantile(sample_pwin$p_win, c(0.025, 0.975))
